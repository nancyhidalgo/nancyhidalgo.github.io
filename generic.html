								<h2>Education</h2>
								<p>B.S. in Electrical Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Graduated 2021 GPA: 4.2</p>
								<p>M.Eng in Electrical Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Expected Graduation June 2022 GPA: 4.7</p>
								<p>Relevant Coursework: CMOS Analog and Mixed Signal Circuit Design, Power Electronics, Solid State Circuits, Analog Laboratory, Digital Laboratory, Micro/Nano Processing Technology,
									Nanoelectronics and Computing Systems (Semiconductor physics), How to Make (Almost) Anything, Circuits and Electronics
									  
								<h2>Skills</h2>
								<p> Hardware: Oscilloscopes, Multimeters, Waveform Generators, Spectrum Analyzers, Soldering </p>
								<p> Software: LTSpice, Eagle/KiCad, Cadence, MATLAB, Python, Arduino, SystemVerilog
								
								<h2>Work Experience</h2>
								<h3> Analog Devices: Design Engineering Intern</h3>
								<p>Designed and simulated a silicon carbide gate driver for electric and hybrid-electric vehicle applications primarily in Cadence Virtuoso. This project formed the basis of master's thesis. This involved designing various analog and mixed-signal subcircuits including floating voltage rail generators, level shifters, and inverter chains. </p>
								
								<h3> Analog Devices: Design Engineering Interm</h3>
								<p> Implemented various power-saving schemes for a high frequency power converter for data center applications, primarily in LTSpice.</p>
								
								<h3> MIT Circuits and Electronics Course Lab Assistant</h3>
								<p> Tested student's understanding of fundamental circuits concepts used in lab exercises. Debugged breadboard and PCB boards used in labs. Helped students through theoretical portions of lab exercises. </p>
								
								<h3>Micron Technology: Competitive Analysis Engineering Intern</h3>
								<p> Worked in a team of four to test competitors' flash memory for power and latency. Updated a battery-life test platform to work for UFS 3.0 memory. This involved modifying hardware and Linux shell scripts.</p>
								
								<h3>MIT Materials Research Laboratory: Undergraduate Researcher</h3>
								<p> Performed experiments with waveguides, ring resonators, and directional couplers. Created MATLAB scripts to analyze data. Wrote a lab manual for other students to use to perform experiments and learn underlying concepts. Co-authored a white paper on the curriculum that was published for a conference on photonics education (ETOP). </p>

								<h3> Universidad Panamericana: Undergraduate Researcher</h3>
								<p> Designed a counterbalanced robot arm using Working Model and SolidWorks. Started fabricating parts.  Collaborated with three researchers to determine possible motor choices and mounting configurations. </p>

								<h3>MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics: Undergraduate Researcher</h3>
								<p> Analyzed 200+ speach sample spectrograms for various acoustic cues using Praat. Led trainings for other researchers and created a tutorial for future researchers to use. </p>
									
								<h3> Applied Research Laboratories at the University of Texas at Austin</h3>
								<p> Redesigned the PCB electronics of an apparatus used to take acoustic measurements underwater. Ran a frequency analysis using MATLAB in underwater testing setup to ensure proper operation. Wrote a lab report that was later published. Created a poster and presented for a panel of scientists. </p>
									
									
								<h2> Leadership and Service</h2>	
									<h3> Discover Electrical Engineering Freshman Pre-Orientation Program: Program Director</h3>
									<p> After After participating in the program as a freshman, I served as a program counselor to introduce freshmen to MIT. 
										Now as director, I organize a week-long program to introduce incoming freshmen to the EECS department, MIT culture, and the Boston Area with a small electronics project, faculty lectures, and excursions. </p>
									
									<h3> Medlinks: Volunteer</h3>
									<p> Served as a liason between MIT students and MIT Medical services. Volunteered in various events to promote physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Provided OTC medications and first aid to students within the living community, as well as aided in conflict resolution and mental health questions. </p>
									
									<h3> Educational Studies Program: Volunteer</h3>
									<p> Volunteered as a teacher for Splash, a weekend-long program for middle and high-schoolers. Taught an introductory American Sign Language class to middle-schoolers. </p>
